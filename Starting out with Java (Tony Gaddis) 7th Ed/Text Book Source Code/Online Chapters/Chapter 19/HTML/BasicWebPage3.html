    There are two types of programs you can create with Java: applications
    and applets. An application is a stand-alone program that runs
    on your computer. Applets are Java programs that are usually
    part of a Web site. They are stored on a Web server along with
    the site's Web pages. When a remote user accesses a Web page
    with his or her browser, any applets associated with the Web
    page are transmitted over the Internet from the server to the
    remote user's system.
